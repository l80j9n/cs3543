ENGL 112: STUDIES IN COMPOSITION 
2023-24 Winter Term 2 
ENGL 112 - 101, 102, 103
ACADEMIC CALENDAR ENTRY: 
Practice-based approach to writing at the university level. Emphasis is placed on the processes of research-based writing. Credit will be granted for only one of ENGL   112,   ENGL   109,   or   ENGL   114
COURSE FORMAT: This course will run online as an asynchronous delivery, which means   it   offers   the   exclusive   use   of   self-guided   materials. Asynchronous   delivery   of   a   course   refers   to   course   instruction    in the form. of   learning materials and exercises that students will   access   and   complete   at their   own pace.
Completing   the   practice   exercises   in   the   workbook   in   a   timely   manner   reinforces   the   development   of university-level skills in critical thinking, reading, writing, and documentation. You   are   expected   to read   the course texts, view the video-taped lectures, and complete the exercises   and   essay   assignments   in the      order   they   arepresented   via   Canvas. The   learning   materials, tools, and   activities—recorded   and   written lectures, powerpoint   demonstrations, practice-based   learning   exercises, and   essay   assignments—are provided in the Custom Course Materials and on Canvas.   Thus, you must   have   an up-to-date   computer   that can run the Canvas tools. You must also have Microsoft Office 365,   a   Canvas-compatible   word processor, to submit the exercises and assignments. (MS Office   365   is   available   free   through UBC). 
COURSE OVERVIEW, CONTENT, AND OBJECTIVES: 
English   112 introduces you to the ways that scholars think about, undertake, and communicate the results   of   their research. The course is designed to help you develop the reading and writing   skills you need to succeed in your university career. It is not a basic course in English   language   skills;   thus, the   expectation   is that your level of   competence will enable you to write academic papers that are   significantly   free   of errors in basic grammar. The course covers the essay-writing process through close reading   strategies, summary, analysis, persuasion, revision, research methods, and documentation. It also includes practice exercises designed to prepare you to construct essays that are appropriate for university-level research writing. ENGL   112 is not discipline specific. Its purpose is to increase your   awareness   of   and   familiarity         with the conventions of   writing and documentation in several disciplines   and help you build the   skills   you   need to write and conduct research in your chosen discipline.
CLOSE READINGS OF COURSE TEXTS: 
The course requires you to engage in active student-based learning to   develop your   skills   in reading comprehension, critical thinking, and writing. You will study fiction,   semi-fictional prose, academic   and   personal essays, and film. You will work through these texts employing “close reading tools” to foster your development of   the critical thinking skills that are essential to   good writing.   You   will   develop   your skills in a variety of   activities such as informal writing   exercises   called inkshedding. See the next page   for   an   explanation   of   this   writing   exercise.
COURSE DESIGN: 
The design of   ENGL   112 is scaffolded or laddered. There is   a repeating   sequence   of   exercises   and inksheds that prepare you to write the formal assignments, and, as you will   see,   each   assignment   is   a   little   more complex than the one before it. That is, the first assignments   assist   students   in   mastering   simple tasks and then the tasks increase in complexity. In these exercises, you   will   learn how to   write   clear   and   concise sentences (using active voice), how to organize the essay   in   a   logical   sequence   of   ideas,   how   to lead the reader from one idea to the next with transitional   sentences, and how   to   format   quotes   and citations to support your analysis with evidence. You will also learn how to   create works   cited lists.
Assignments   1 and 2 focus on quoting and citing prescribed primary   and   secondary   sources.   1   and   2   are   two-page summary exercises designed to assist you in   developing   skills   in   analysis,   in   documentation (quoting and citing sources), and in writing clear and   concise   sentences.   1   and   2   will   also   help   you   develop   grammar   skills   regardless   of   the   level   of   skill   you   have   when   you   begin   the   course. 
Assignments   1 and 2 also help you develop awareness of   essay structure   and   create   logical   sequences   of   ideas and quotes. To help you acquire these basic skills, you will practice   by   quoting prescribed   sources      (those in the coursepack). You will also learn how to write leading   statements and   transitional   sentences.   In Assignment 3, you will learn how to quote and cite   speakers in   a   film   (another prescribed   secondary source) which adds a new level of   complexity.
Assignment 5 builds on the skills you will have developed   in Assignments   1,   2,   and   3, but   it   adds   yet another level of   complexity in that it requires you to search the library   catalogue   and   choose two   scholarly   secondary sources to support your discussion of   your chosen topic. Assignment   4 requires you to summarize your chosen sources in annotated bibliographies before writing the research essay.   Ultimately,   you will learn how to design an argument and how to write a thesis   statement.   Assignment   5   invites   you    to demonstrate the skills you have developed. 
REVISION: 
An important goal of   this course is to encourage you, through feedback   on your   writing, to   engage   in   the   practices   of   revision   as   essential   components   of   the   writing   process. I   use   an   editorial   tool   called Track Changes to respond to your assignments and to provide modeling. You are required to revise all assignments to increase the clarity of   your ideas and to correct grammar   and   spelling   errors.   The revision   process also offers you opportunities to increase your critical thinking skills. Your revised   drafts   should         indicate that you have read the comments I have provided in the sidebar (using Track   Changes)   and have   applied my suggestions and modeling to the best of   your ability. As you revise and   develop your   skills, the quality of   your writing and presentation should improve, and your grade   should   increase. 
INKSHEDS: Learning to write as you write to learn.Developing writing skills requires practice. Inksheds are low-stakes exercises that invite you to write   nonstop for   10 minutes on prompts based on the texts. Inksheds offer you   time to practice writing and   increase your knowledge of   the texts. You should expect to write two inksheds each week.   I   grade inksheds on form. (writing quality), on content   (the   quality   of   ideas),   and   on length   (quantity).   The   quality   and   quantity   of   inksheds   should   increase   over   the   semester. 
LEARNING OUTCOMES: 
After completing this course, students should be   able to:
1.       Find, evaluate, integrate,   and   synthesize primary   and   secondary   source material   (including   quotations, paraphrase, and   summary), develop   atopic   into   a   thesis, and   provide   suitable    authority and context;
2.       Document sources fully   and   ethically   according to   a   current   scholarly   documentation   system   (for      example, MLA and/or APA), informed by Indigenous Style. (e.g., per   Greg Younging’s Elements of Indigenous style: a guide for writing by and about Indigenous Peoples, or   some   similar   guide);
3.       Craft and revise   sentences that   are   grammatically   sound   and use   an   appropriate   level   of   diction;
4.       Practice   a   university-level   writing   process: prewriting, planning, multiple   drafting,   conferring,   integrating research, revising, editing, and proofreading;

Grading Practices 
Faculties, departments, and schools reserve the right to scale grades   in order   to maintain   equity   among   sections and conformity to university, faculty, department, or school norms.   Students   should therefore   note that an unofficial grade given by an instructor might be changed by the   faculty,   department,   or school. Grades are not official until they appear on a   student’s   academic record.
